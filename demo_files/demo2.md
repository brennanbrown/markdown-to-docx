# Table Demo Document 📊

This document focuses on testing **tables** and **advanced formatting**.

## Sample Data Table

| Product | Price | Availability | Rating |
|---------|-------|--------------|--------|
| MacBook Pro | $2,399 | ✅ In Stock | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Complex Formatting

### Nested Lists with Mixed Content

1. **First Level Item**
   - Sub-item with *italic text*
   - Another sub-item with `code`
   
2. **Second Level Item**
   - More complex content
     - Even deeper nesting
     - With **bold** and *italic*
   
3. **Third Level Item**
   - Final level content

### Mathematical Expressions

Although basic markdown doesn't support math, we can show:
- Variables: x, y, z
- Equations: E = mc²
- Formulas: (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

### Special Characters

Testing various characters:
- Arrows: → ← ↑ ↓
- Symbols: © ® ™ § ¶
- Currency: $ € £ ¥
- Math: ± × ÷ ≈ ≠

This should all convert beautifully to DOCX format!
